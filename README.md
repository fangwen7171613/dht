# DHT - Distributed Hash Table

**DHT** is a component of the Software Development Platform (SDP), delivering a scalable and high-performance distributed hash table, akin to Redis but engineered to provide greater performance and scalability.

## Overview

DHT is designed to support clustering and load balancing, allowing for theoretically unlimited performance enhancements compared to traditional caching systems. Its distributed nature ensures scalability and high availability, making it ideal for modern applications that require rapid access to large volumes of data.

## Features

- **High-Performance Operations**: Fast data retrieval to support demanding applications that require quick access to stored data.
- **Scalability**: Ability to scale horizontally across clusters, catering to growing data and user base without a drop in performance.
- **Load Balancing**: Efficient distribution of data across nodes to maximize resource usage and minimize latency.
- **Cluster Support**: Ensures data is always available and can withstand node failures, providing robust fault tolerance.

## Getting Started

To incorporate DHT into your project, start by cloning the SDP repository and navigate to the DHT module:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fangwen7171613/sdp.git
cd sdp/src/dht
# Follow the build and installation instructions provided within the SDP repository
